    <h1>
        Why Codeframe?
    </h1>

    <div class="subtitle">
        Making a tool for first-time creators
    </div>

    <a href="#permalink" class="permalink">Permalink</a>

    <p>
        So. Why did I make this? Well,
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to work on side projects <em>all the time</em>. My computer is
        littered with quick, small projects from random late nights and weekends
        where I found some time to start hacking on random ideas entertain myself
        or make my life less repetitive. But as I built more and more projects,
        I saw that the least interesting part about starting a new idea –– setting
        everything up, configuring files and scripts –– was also the biggest deterrent
        to my creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I started another side project! Enter <strong class="inline fixed button">Codeframe</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started building Codeframe to solve this problem: it's meant to be <strong>the fastest way
            to go from idea to code running on a live webpage that can be shared with
            anyone on the planet.</strong> Everything from the technical stack from top to bottom,
        to the simplicity of the UI, to the fact that <a href="https://linus.zone/torus">Torus</a>
        comes included into every Codeframe, is designed with the goal of speed of creativity in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also frequently run into opportunities to teach web design and development,
        and find myself wanting something more lightweight and approachable than CodePen,
        Glitch, and Repl.it, which are fantastic alternatives but often too heavy
        or complex for beginners in web development. For these times, Codeframe is
        meant to be a simpler, more approachable alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
        But above all, <strong>Codeframe exists to make it easier to learn how to make things
            on the web, and to make it faster and more painless to build things for the web.</strong>
        If you're a maker of beautiful things on the Internet, I hope you give Codeframe
        a try, and I hope you love it.
